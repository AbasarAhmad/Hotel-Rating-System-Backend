Before Microservices: 
*	Monolithic architecture: multiple components are combined in single large app. 
*	Single Code Base 
*	Deployment in single bundle 
*	Change in one service then whole app is redeployed 
*	Building problem: developers has to communicate
*	Problem in scale
*	Cumbersome over time
 
 

Microservices: 
•	Large apps are divide into small parts 
•	Different codebase 
•	Each module managed independently 
•	Different tech stack 
•	Handling microservices is complex 



Eureka
1. What is Eureka?
Eureka is a Service Discovery Server used so microservices can find each other automatically.

2. Why we use Eureka?
•	Services run on different ports
•	Ports change when restarting
•	Hardcoding URLs breaks the system
Eureka keeps a registry of all services and their locations.

3. How Eureka works?
Each microservice registers itself to Eureka:
Example Services & Ports
UserService   → localhost:8081
HotelService  → localhost:8082
RatingService → localhost:8083
Eureka stores this information like a phone directory.

4. Real-Life Eureka = Hotel Reception
•	Microservices = Rooms
Guests don’t search rooms themselves —
they ask reception: “Room 8082 kaha hai?”
Similarly:
UserService → asks Eureka → “Where is HotelService?”
Eureka → returns actual URL (localhost:8082)
