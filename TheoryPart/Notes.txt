Before Microservices: 
*	Monolithic architecture: multiple components are combined in single large app. 
*	Single Code Base 
*	Deployment in single bundle 
*	Change in one service then whole app is redeployed 
*	Building problem: developers has to communicate
*	Problem in scale
*	Cumbersome over time
 
 

Microservices: 
•	Large apps are divide into small parts 
•	Different codebase 
•	Each module managed independently 
•	Different tech stack 
•	Handling microservices is complex
